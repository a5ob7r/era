Then,

```

To exit, press any key.

## Customization

`config.json` looks like this:

```
{"interval":100,"frequency":40,"rain1":"â”‚","rain2":" ","timecolor":"#eeeeee","raincolor":"#e0b0ff"}
```

`interval` means how often the screen is updated (a.k.a how fast it rains). The bigger this number, The slower it rains.  
The larger `frequency`, the fewer the raindrops.  
`rain1` and `rain2` are characters representing raindrops. By default `rain2` is just a whitespace, so raindrops are represented by rain1 (|) only. Of course you can change the shape of raindrops!
