v0.1.0  
A rainy clock.

![sample gif](gif/sample.gif)

## Usage
First, git clone and compile it.
```
git clone https://github.com/kyoheiu/era
cd era
make
```
Then,
```
./era
```
creates `config.json` in your `CONFIG_HOME/era/` and you have a rainy clock.

## Customization
`config.json` looks like this:
```
{"interval":100,"frequency":40,"rain1":"â”‚","rain2":" "}
```

`interval` means how often the screen is updated (a.k.a how fast it rains). The bigger this number, The faster it rains.    
The larger `frequency`, the fewer the raindrops.  
`rain1` and `rain2` are characters representing raindrops. By default `rain2` is empty, so raindrops are represented by rain1 (|) only. Of course you can change the shape of raindrops!
